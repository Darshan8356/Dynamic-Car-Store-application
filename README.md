# Dynamic-Car-Store-application

The Dynamic Car Store application is a comprehensive Java-based web solution for managing a car inventory system. Built using JSP, Servlets, and JDBC, it allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on car data stored in a MySQL database. Users can manage details such as the carâ€™s model, brand, price, and other attributes. The front-end is powered by JSP, offering an interactive user interface, while Servlets handle the business logic and database requests. JDBC ensures secure and efficient communication with the database, making inventory management smooth and scalable. The system provides a dynamic, real-time view of the car inventory, simplifying administrative tasks in car dealerships.
